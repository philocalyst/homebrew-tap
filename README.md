## Disclaimer

All of these taps are not notarized, which means they don't benefit from Apple's static and dynamic analysis of the codebase for malware and security. In addition, they automatically remove any quarantine safeguards for the downloaded app. Understand that while the risk of downloading something unsafe through these taps is very small, it is much more likely than from a highly protected area like the app store, or even through the official Homebrew directory. 

Cautiously,
Miles
